# Webservice Plugin 2.0

For those times when you need a quick and dirty webservice for your data.

## The changed part which I performed 

The fault which does not work is corrected when it is used by CakePHP2.2.x.

It corresponds to the CallBack of JSONP.
The example of use

	http://localhost/hoge/index.json?callback=method


## Background

While working on a freelance app, I realized I was spending way too much time trying to create a well-maintained separation between the API and the frontend. There was no need to do this, the api users would figure out how to use it in time. So I decided to create a View class to auto-transform the data into JSON and XML. The result is the `Webservice View`.

Later, I wanted to move an entire controller to webservice, but have it also optionally render html. As a result, I created the `Webservice Component`.

## Requirements

* CakePHP 2.x

## Installation

For 1.3 support, please see the [1.3 branch](https://github.com/josegonzalez/webservice_plugin/tree/1.3).

_[Manual]_

* Download this: [https://github.com/josegonzalez/webservice_plugin/zipball/master](https://github.com/josegonzalez/webservice_plugin/zipball/master)
* Unzip that download.
* Copy the resulting folder to `app/Plugin`
* Rename the folder you just copied to `Webservice`

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:

	git submodule add git://github.com/josegonzalez/webservice_plugin.git Plugin/Webservice
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type

	git clone git://github.com/josegonzalez/webservice_plugin.git Webservice

### Enable plugin

In 2.0 you need to enable the plugin your `app/Config/bootstrap.php` file:

    CakePlugin::load('Webservice');

If you are already using `CakePlugin::loadAll();`, then this is not necessary.


## Usage

Specify the extensions you'd like to parse in `Config/routes.php`, for example:

	Router::parseExtensions('json');

Attach the `Webservice Component` to your controller for an instant _automagic_ webservice:

	<?php
	class PostsController extends AppController {

		public $components = array(
			'RequestHandler',
			'Webservice.Webservice'
		);
		public function index() {
			$posts = array();
			$this->set(compact('posts'));
		}

	}

	<?php
	class PostsController extends AppController {

		public $components = array(
			'RequestHandler',
			'Webservice.Webservice'
		);

	}

Or simply set the `Webservice` View class where necessary (don't forget `Router::parseExtensions()` and `CakeRequest->type()`):

	<?php
	class PostsController extends AppController {

		public $components = array('RequestHandler');

		public function index() {
			$this->request->type(array('json' => 'application/json'));
			$this->viewClass = 'Webservice.Webservice';
			$posts = $this->paginate();
			$this->set(compact('posts'));
		}

	}

Views are not necessary, the View class takes care of everything.

### Blacklisting actions

On occasion, it will be necessary to specify certain actions as not having a webservice response. To do so, you can either specify a property on the Controller or specify it in the component configuration:

	<?php
	class PostsController extends AppController {

		public $viewClass = 'Webservice.Webservice';

		// In the component configuration
		public $components = array(
			'Webservice.Webservice' => array(
				'blacklist' => array('home', 'index')
			)
		);

		// As a class property
		public $webserviceBlacklist = array(
			'home', 'index'
		);

	}

The `$webserviceBlacklist` property will be merged into the `settings` array if available.

You can also specify `*` to blacklist all actions.

	<?php
	class PostsController extends AppController {

		public $webserviceBlacklist = array('*');

	}

The `$webserviceBlacklist` property will be merged into the `settings` array if available.

You can also specify `*` to blacklist all actions.

	<?php
	class PostsController extends AppController {

		public $webserviceBlacklist = array('*');

	}

### Blacklisting variables

It is possible to blacklist certain variables from being output. By default, these are the following reserved variables:

* `debugToolbarPanels`
* `debugToolbarJavascript`
* `webserviceTextarea`
* `webserviceNoxjson`

To blacklist more variables, you can use the `$webserviceBlacklistVars` controller property.

	<?php
	class PostsController extends AppController {

		public $webserviceBlacklistVars = array(
			'_metas'
		);

		public function index() {
			$someMetaInfo = array('some', 'meta', 'info');
			$this->set('_metas', $someMetaInfo); // Will not be in output
		}

	}

### Outputting session flash messages

Session flash messages are not output by default, but this can be turned on through a controller property:

	<?php
	class PostsController extends AppController {

		public $webserviceSessionFlash = true;

	}

This will include all the relevant data for you to decide how to output the flash messages on your current page.

## TODO

1. Unit Tests
2. More thorough documentation
3. YAML and Serialized PHP output
